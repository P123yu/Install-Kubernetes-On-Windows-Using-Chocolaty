# Kubernetes & Minikube Installation Guide (Windows)

This guide covers the clean installation of Kubernetes tools using Chocolatey on Windows.

### ⚠️ Prerequisites
1.  **Docker Desktop** must be installed and running (Look for the whale icon in the taskbar).
2.  **PowerShell** must be run as **Administrator**.

---

### Step 1: Install Chocolatey (Package Manager)
*If you already have Chocolatey installed, skip to Step 2.*

1. Copy and paste the command below into your **Administrator** PowerShell window:
   
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

Verify installation:
Powershell
choco -v
(Output should be a version number, e.g., 2.3.0)


Step 2: Install Kubectl
kubectl is the command-line tool used to interact with the cluster.
Run the install command:
Powershell
choco install kubernetes-cli -y


Verify installation:
Powershell
kubectl version --client


Step 3: Install Minikube
minikube is the tool that creates the virtual Kubernetes cluster on your computer.
Run the install command:
Powershell
choco install minikube -y

Refersh Environment Variables (Important!):
Run this command so Windows "sees" the new installation immediately without closing the window.
Powershell
refreshenv
Verify installation:

Powershell
minikube version
(If you see an error here, close PowerShell and open a new Administrator window).


Step 4: Start the Cluster
Now we turn on the virtual machine inside Docker.
Start Minikube using the Docker driver:

Powershell

minikube start --driver=docker
(Note: This may take a few minutes the first time as it downloads Kubernetes images).

Step 5: Verify & Start Working
Check if your cluster node is running and ready.
Get node status:

Powershell
kubectl get nodes

Expected Output:
NAME       STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
minikube   Ready    control-plane   17s   v1.30.0
✅ You are now ready to deploy applications!
